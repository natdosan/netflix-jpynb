# netflix-jpynb
First Project Using jpynb!

This involves a user's actual data from Netflix ( obtain yours here https://www.netflix.com/login?nextpage=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netflix.com%2Faccount%2Fgetmyinfo )
and plots it on a graph.

From here, you can observe any trends in watchtimes and can filter out shows by changing the string in the str.contains() to the title of the show you want

You can go through the comments to adjust the timezone as well if you are not on US/Pacific
